example1 is a simple, barebone plugin example w/o extra dependencies(other than for grip2).
There are four folders: src, include, ui and lib
If a user complie & build example1 project, then the resulting plugin library(libmyplugin.so) will be generated in lib folder.
For a test purpose, lib folder already has myplugin.so in it.
The plugin library(libmyplugin.so) can be loaded from grip2.
